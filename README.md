# META-B-ML-Project
Project Name: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning 

Project Summary: 

In this project META-B will be using machine learning to predict heart disease in an individual. We will be creating visualizations in tableau to portray potential correlations and host all of our work on an HTML platform which will allow for user input to see if they are potentially at risk for heart disease. Finally, our application will be launched to the web for easy access using Heroku.
